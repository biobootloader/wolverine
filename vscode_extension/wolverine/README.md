# Wolverine: An AI-powered Code Healing Extension for VS Code
It's 2020 + 3. Let's stop tabbing away from our text editor, shall we?

Wolverine is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to assist developers in the code modification process. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate code suggestions and edits in real-time. By directly integrating with your text editor, Wolverine can improve your efficiency and help resolve coding issues.


## Usage instructions 
Right now, this isn't published, because there isn't a good mechanism for having the openAI key through a keychain. So to use; You're going to have to run a build.
Furthermore; the code is in a bit of a sorry state. This was a really quick hack - which is planned to be improved upon.
- `Pull the repository`
- `cd vscode_extension/wolverine`
- `npm install`
- `npm run package && npm run vsce`. This will generate a vsix file
- ctrl shift p => install extensions  
- click the three little dots on top right of the extension window
- choose the vsix file you just generated

## Development instructions
Do you want to mess with this and change things on your own?
- Start a vscode instance in this current directory. Not the main repo; but `./vscode_extension/wolverine`
- ctrl+shift+p => debug extension (f11 hotkey default) 
- this will launch a new code editor; with a debugger attached to your main window

## Key Features
### Directed Code Healing
Wolverine introduces a 'directedHeal' command. This command lets you select a block of code that you'd like to replace or improve. Simply select the code, execute the 'directedHeal' command, and the extension will replace the selected code with improved code generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

### Contextual Assistance
Wolverine understands the context of your code. It utilizes the surrounding code (visible in your text editor) to generate meaningful and coherent code replacements that align with your existing codebase.

### Real-Time Streaming of AI Responses:
The extension streams the AI-generated code in real-time, providing a seamless experience. It buffers the AI responses and updates the text editor at regular intervals, making the process efficient and smooth.

### How to Use
Select the piece of code you want to replace in your text editor.
Run the 'wolverine.directedHeal' command.
Watch as Wolverine replaces your selected code with AI-generated code.

Note
Please ensure that you have an active OpenAI key to use this extension, as it leverages the OpenAI API for generating the code.
